	<h1>Pong Fans</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the website dedicated to the pong game. Created in 1972 our website is the go to for millions of fans around the world.</p>
	<!-- <img src="img/game.png" alt="the original pong graphisms" title="the original pong graphisms"> -->
	<h2>Gameplay</h2>
	<p>The game’s goal is to make your opponent miss the ball when it gets passed to their side of the screen. When your opponent misses the ball, you gain a point. To win, you need to obtain eleven points in total.</p>
	<h2>Strategies</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><details><summary>With Modern Controls Can Help (Or Not)</summary>Pong was initially played as an arcade game and then was played at home on its own console. A dial moved the paddles, sending the paddle Up or Down. Thus, the AI is still “playing” as if you are using those old controllers, even if you swop for a mouse or a keyboard.
			However, your computer controllers might also sabotage your success. 
			The safest way to play Pong on your computer is the keyboard. You can go Up or Down, and that’s it. But it is also the slowest way to play Pong. Some argue that certain gaming keyboards give you an edge, but others claim this is nonsense. 
			However, the mouse will be faster. Thus, the mouse can give you an edge. You can even put your mouse on even higher settings and move the paddles incredibly quickly. 
			All of which is brilliant, except when it isn’t. 
			The mouse can also be a nightmare. First, set it too fast, and the old programming can’t keep up, and it will just glitch, and your mouse moves without taking the paddle along. 
			The other issue is that the mouse does not just move up and down but all over. Nor can you “see” the cursor until you’re off the page, so it is easy to lose track of your movements. Pong gives you some leeway, but eventually, you lose connection to the paddle, and the ball bounces past. 
			Thus, playing Pong with a mouse can be advantageous if you practice.
		</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Use Dominate Hand When Playing Pong On A Console</summary>if you have the good fortune to play Pong on an original Atari console or arcade, you will have a nob controller. You roll the dial UP or Down, and that’s it. You will play strongest with your dominant hand. But if you want to give yourself a challenge (and up the likelihood of losing), play with your weaker hand.
		</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Try To Increase Window’s Size</summary>Usually, the bigger you can make your computer window while playing Pong, the easier it will be to play. Some Pong games have a fixed window size, but others adjust depending on if you are playing on your device. So the bigger screen will be easier, increasing your chances of beating an AI. 
			Obviously, if you are playing a two-person game, the advantage a larger screen gives you is also given to your opponent. In two-player games, the person used to playing on the smallest screen will have the advantage.
		</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Start Pong On Easy Level To Learn Controllers<</summary>The Pong controls feel different depending on what you are playing on; thus, it makes sense to play a few rounds on the easy level as you get the hang of them. Certain controls, such as arrow keys, can sometimes feel painfully slow. Thus, you need to adjust your timing to suit the tools.
		</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>There Is No Spinning In Pong</summary>Pong is not ping-pong. Pong is a 2D world where paddles can move up and down, and that’s it. There are no short shots, long shots, spins, or any other fancy move you can dream up. Pong is a very basic computer game, using what is in today’s world beginner programming skills. The game has specific rules of law, and that’s how it works. 
			Play the game, not ping-pong, and your road to success will be quicker.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Learn Pong’s Algorithm</summary>Pong operates according to a specific algorithm. Once you learn its laws, you can predict moves. No matter your opponent moves, there is a predictable consequence. Each time the square ball is hit at that specific height against that paddle section, the ball will react the same. There is no random generator to throw you off.
		</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Count The Volleys In Pong</summary>New players to Pong often feel like the ball is constantly speeding up. But that isn’t true. The volley picks up speed on the fourth and twelfth volley. If you count the volleys, you’ll know precisely when the speed changes. However, the real kicker isn’t the “speed” but the changes it makes to the paddle.
		</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Learn Pong’s Paddle</summary>Pong’s paddle is seven blocks high. Each block has a predetermined angle set to the speed. These angles do not change no matter how fast or slow you get to the ball. There is no fancy trick to alter how the paddle works. For example, the middle block will always hit the ball back in a perfect horizontal line. Always. 
			The other six blocks have a set angle depending on the volley. Thus, there is a fixed angle for volleys 1-3, another for 4-11, and then the steepest settings for volleys 12 and above. If you watch your opponent’s paddle and count the volleys, you can, in theory, predict where the ball is going.
		</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Don’t Constantly Move Pong’s Paddle</summary>Moving the paddle mindlessly up and down is wasted energy and isn’t distracting the AI or an opponent. It also increases the likelihood you’ll be out of position when the ball returns. Wait until you have a general idea of where the ball is going, then move your paddle.
		</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Get The Paddle There Early In Pong</summary>The instant you think you know where you need to be, move. Then pause, if possible, and hit the ball at the last moment. This limits your opponent’s time to see where you will send the ball. Remember, if the opponent can easily see what part of the paddle the ball hits, they can theoretically know exactly where the ball will go. 
			Hit at the last moment to give yourself the greatest chance of success.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Try To Use The Paddle’s Edges In Pong</summary>The paddle’s two outside blocks are what send the ball veering off the furthest, making your opponent have to move around the most.
		</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Shoot For The Corners In Pong</summary>Try to aim for your opponent’s corners of the screens. These are “holes” in the game where the ball sails past even if the bat is right there. It’s just how Pong works. You hit the corners of the playing screen; the ball will not be returned.
		</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Learn To Predict Pong’s Serve</summary>Pong’s serve seems random, but it is carrying on from the angle it left the screen. It’s like two screens wrapped together to make a tube. So, if it goes off-screen dead center, it is coming in from the net dead center. Likewise, if the ball exited your screen at an angle, it will reemerge from the net at the opposite angle it left. 
			The best way to master this is to miss a bunch of balls and focus on how they re-enter. Sure, you lose a game or few, but once you get the hang of how the serve works, you’ll have another Pong skill to lead you to victory.
		</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Distract Your Opponent</summary>If you are not playing an AI, a less-sporting (but potentially hilarious) way to win is to distract your opponent. The possibilities are near endless. Just remember to stay focused when you do it. Distracting your opponent with a loud fart doesn’t work if you start laughing too.

	<h2>About Pong</h2>
	<p>
		
		Pong is one of the first computer games that ever created, this simple "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain10 point, a player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball. The game can be played with two human players, or one player against a computer controlled paddle. The game was originally developed by Allan Alcorn and released in 1972 by Atari corporations. Soon, Pong became a huge success, and became the first commercially successful game, on 1975, Atari release a home edition of Pong (the first version was played on Arcade machines) which sold 150,000 units. Today, the Pong Game is considered to be the game which started the video games industry, as it proved that the video games market can produce significant revenues.
		
		Nolan Bushnell founded Atari at 1972 in order to create games and ideas and license them to other companies for mass production. Pong was actually a training exercise for one of Atari's employees - Allan Alcorn, once it was finished, Nolan made few adjustments in order to make the game more interesting (like changing the ball's return angle) and added simple sound effects. The first Pong Arcade machine was installed on a local bar, and it was so successful that Atari decided to produce and sell the game by themselves, rather then licensing it to other companies. In 1973 the company finally got a line of credit from Wells Fargo and started an assembly line, by the end of the year, Pong arcade machines were shipped to location all over the U.S. as well as to other countries.
		Similar to other famous games such as Pacman and Tetris, Pong became one of the symbols of computer gaming.
		
		Atari sold more then 35000 Pong machines, this figure is only about one third of the total number of Pong machines that were sold globally, since many Pong clones appeared shortly after the debut of the original Atari Pong game. The way Atari chose to compete with the Pong Game clones was to produce more innovative games such as "Double Pong" which was a pong game with four players, two in every side and a bigger screen.
